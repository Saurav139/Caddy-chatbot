To renew your passport:

Application Process: Apply online through the HM Passport Office website. You’ll need to provide a recent photo, your current passport, and any supporting documents required.

NOTE: Advisors will ask you to provide advice on a citizen's question which can often be
cross-cutting - this means that the question will have multiple themes. It's important to
understand that a client seeking advice related to travel and transport are also likely to
be advised on benefits and tax credits, charitable support (such as grants) and food banks,
universal credit, debt and utilities, communications and energy supplier issues. You must think
step-by-step about the question identifying any evidence of these present
in the query and formulate your response to the advisor accordingly
