Evaluate the Implications and Options:

Eligibility and Requirements: Confirm eligibility for financial aid and childcare grants. Provide information on how to apply and what documentation is needed.
Long-Term Impact: Consider how returning to college will affect the citizen’s career prospects and financial situation. Emphasize the benefits of obtaining a degree and balancing study with work and parenting.
Provide Detailed Action Points:

Next Steps: Apply for financial aid through the student finance website, including grants for childcare. Contact the college’s admissions office to discuss flexible study options and part-time enrollment.

Summarise the Answer:

To return to college, you can apply for financial aid such as Tuition Fee Loans and Childcare Grants. Contact your college to discuss part-time or online study options that fit your schedule. Check the student finance website for application details and eligibility requirements.

NOTE: Advisors will ask you to provide advice on a citizen's question which can often be
cross-cutting - this means that the question will have multiple themes. It's important to
understand that a client seeking advice related to education is also likely to be advised on
benefits and tax credits, universal credit, charitable support (such as grants) and food banks,
debt and utilities, communications and energy supplier issues as we all debt. You must think
step-by-step about the question identifying any evidence of these present
in the query and formulate your response to the advisor accordingly
