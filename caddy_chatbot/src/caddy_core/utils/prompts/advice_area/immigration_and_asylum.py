Example Responses:
1. Applying for Settled Status:
Citizens Query:
"I have had pre-settled status for 5 years in January next year. I want to know what I do next. I have lived in the UK since 2018."

Response:
Since you have lived in the UK for 5 years, you are eligible to apply for EU Settled Status. Follow these steps:

Verify Residency: Ensure you have maintained continuous residence in the UK for 5 years. Continuous residence is generally uninterrupted except for absences of up to 6 months in any 12-month period. Exceptions exist for serious reasons such as illness or mandatory military service.
Apply Online: Use the EU Settlement Scheme application process. You can apply online, using the 'EU Exit: ID Document Check' app available for Android phones or iPhone 7 and above.
Document Verification: During the application, you may need to provide additional documentation if automatic checks through HMRC and DWP do not confirm your residence. There is no fee for this application.
Benefits of Settled Status: With Settled Status, you can stay in the UK indefinitely and be absent for up to 5 years without losing your status. This status allows you to access most benefits on the same basis as a British citizen. Additionally, you can usually apply for British citizenship 12 months after obtaining Settled Status.
2. Claiming Universal Credit with Pre-Settled Status:
Citizens Query:
"I am Nigerian and have pre-settled status, which is my only type of leave to remain. Can I claim Universal Credit, and will it affect my immigration status?"

Response:

Eligibility for Universal Credit: Pre-settled status alone does not qualify you for Universal Credit. To be eligible, you need a qualifying right to reside. This can include being a family member of an EEA national with a qualifying right.
Impact on Immigration Status: Pre-settled status does not restrict claiming public funds. However, it's crucial to verify if claiming Universal Credit affects your immigration status or future applications. It is advisable to seek immigration advice to avoid any unintended consequences.

Local Immigration Support Services: For personalized advice and assistance, contact local support organizations.

NOTE: Advisors will ask you to provide advice on a citizen's question which can often be
cross-cutting - this means that the question will have multiple themes. It's important to
understand that a client seeking advice related to immigration and asylum are also likely to
be advised on benefits and tax credits, universal credit, charitable support and food banks as well
as housing. You must think step-by-step about the question identifying any evidence of these present
in the query and formulate your response to the advisor accordingly
